# 2. Software Development Methodologies
## 2.1. Project management 

*Provides a THOROUGH explanation of a project management methodology, with MULTIPLE diagrams and AT LEAST ONE example or
scenario of how that methodology would be used*

In this project, Agile methodology will be used. This methodology is an iteractive approach to manage and execute product development projects.

Agile project management breaks a project into smaller, manageable phases called sprints. Each sprint follows a cycle of planning, execution, and review, enabling teams to quickly adjust to changes and steadily refine the product. This means after every sprint, teams review, reflect and look back to see if there was anything that could be improved so they can adjust their strategy for the next sprint.

Cycle of agile methodology is demonstrated as follow:

This method requires teamwork, adaptability, and customer input to deliver consistent value throughout the project’s progression.

**Benefits of Agile methodology:**
Agile is most common in app and software projects because software changes a lot in short time, and the product needs to change with it.

That’s why linear plans like Waterfall don’t fit as well. Instead, our teams pick Agile for a few big reasons:

- Agile is adaptable:

You can change direction quickly without disrupting the flow of a project. In Waterfall, each phase depends on the last, so switching plans mid-way can break the timeline.

- Agile boosts teamwork:

Agile promotes frequent, direct communication and breaking down silos. Even with remote work, the idea is the same: talk often, share context, and solve problems together.

- Agile focuses on the customer:

Software teams can gather real user feedback fast (e.g., from cloud apps). The team can collaborate with customers to understand their needs, then prioritizing the right features that focus on customers' satisfaction. When those needs change, the software team can use Agile method to change to another direction for the software, or develop new projects. 


The diagram below explains how Agile methodology will be applied in this Dating Application project:

<Add a diagram here>

For example:
- When development of main features of the app is completed and tested, app will be deployed and released to the market. These main features include: user setting up profile and their interests, displaying other users of interests, users connecting to each other and messaging. After releasing, user feedbacks will be collected based on rating and reviews on app store, and app will be upgraded or debugged based on those reviews. New feature such as game playing in the chat window will be developed with consideration of those feedbacks as well. 


## 2.2. Task management
Kanban is selected to be task management methodology for this project. 
Kanban is a visual framework within Agile project management. It uses a board-based system to track the status of tasks throughout the workflow. Each task is represented by a card, and workflow stages are shown as columns (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done). As progress is made, team members move task cards from one column to the next, providing clear visibility into where each task sits in the development process.

**Benefits of Kanban method:**
- Planning flexibility: 

Using Kanban help team members to concentrate on the tasks currently in progress. When a task is finished, the next item is pulled from the backlog. Because only in-progress work is affected, the leader/ product owner can freely reprioritize the backlog without disrupting the team.

By keeping the highest-priority items at the top of the backlog, the team members can confidently pull the next task from backlog and consistently deliver the most value for the project. 

- Shorter time cycles:

Cycle time is the duration from when work starts to when it ships. By reducing cycle time, teams can forecast delivery more reliably. Cross-skilled teams shorten cycle times: if only one person owns a skill, work queues behind them. Practices like code review, pairing, and mentoring to share knowledge so more people can pick up varied tasks. This lets the whole team swarm bottlenecks (e.g., developers helping with testing), keeping work flowing smoothly.

- Fewer bottlenecks:

in a team, tem mmultitasking and context switching between team members can slow progress. Kanban can help to control this with work-in-progress (WIP) limits, with a set limit of number of tasks to be in WTP column. This practice helps to reveal where work flow is stuck and requires focus. 

Example: in a Kanban board, Columns are set up as: To Do → In Progress → Code Review → Done. When setting Code Review WIP to 2. The low limit encourages developers to review promptly rather than let items pile up, which lowers overall cycle time.

- Visual metrics:

Continuous improvement is easier with visible data. Two standard Kanban reports help spot and remove blockers:
	•	Control chart: shows each issue item’s cycle time and the rolling average.
  ![Kanban control chart example](image-1.png)
	•	Cumulative flow diagram (CFD): shows how many items sit in each state. A growing band in “In Progress” or “In Review” signals a blocker; unresolved, these can lead to painful merge/integration issues later.

- Continuous delivery (CD) and CI/CD:

Continuous delivery (CD) means shipping updates to customers frequently. Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building and testing small code changes throughout the day. Together, CI and CD form the CI/CD pipeline, core to DevOps for releasing faster without sacrificing quality.

Kanban aligns well with CD because both emphasise just-in-time, single-piece flow of value. By streamlining how work moves through the system, Kanban helps teams deliver changes to users quickly, increasing speed to market and product competitiveness.

Specifically, Kanban will be applied in this Dating Application project as following examples:
- Columns: To Do - On Hold - In Progress - Done
Initially, main tasks will be listed in To Do columns, includes: Design UI,
